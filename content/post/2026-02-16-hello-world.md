Hey there! I'm **Yusuf Sertkaya**, and this is my corner of the internet.

## Why this blog?

I built this space to share what I learn and build across **AI**, **Data Science**, **MLOps**, and **full-stack development**. From Kaggle competitions to hackathon projects, from data pipelines to web apps — I want to document the journey.

## What to expect

- Hands-on tutorials and walkthroughs
- Insights from Kaggle competitions and hackathons
- MLOps and Data Engineering deep dives
- Full-stack project breakdowns

Stay tuned — there's a lot more coming!
